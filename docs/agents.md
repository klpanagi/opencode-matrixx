## Morpheus — The Orchestrator

![Meet Morpheus](../.github/assets/morpheus.png)

In The Matrix, Morpheus was the captain who saw the truth beyond the simulation and freed minds from the system. LLM Agents are trapped in their own kind of matrix — limited context windows, fragmented tools, and isolated sessions.

**Yes! LLM Agents are no different from us. They can write code as brilliant as ours and work just as excellently — if you give them great tools and solid teammates.**

Meet the main agent: **Morpheus** (Claude Opus 4.6). Everything below is customizable. All features are enabled by default. Battery included, works out of the box.

### What Morpheus Does

1. **Delegates, doesn't grind** — fires off background tasks to faster, cheaper models in parallel to map the territory. Keeps the main context lean.
2. **Surgical refactoring** — leverages LSP for deterministic, safe, surgical code changes.
3. **Specialist delegation** — UI work goes to Sati (Claude Sonnet 4.6). Debugging goes to Merovingian (Claude Sonnet 4.6). The right model for the right job.
4. **Contextual awareness** — spawns subagents to digest source code and documentation in real-time when working with unfamiliar frameworks.
5. **Clean code enforcement** — either justifies a comment's existence or nukes it. Code should be indistinguishable from human-written.
6. **Relentless execution** — bound by the TODO list. If he doesn't finish, the system forces him back. Your task gets done, period.
7. **One keyword** — type `ultrawork` (or just `ulw`). Morpheus analyzes, gathers context, digs through external source code, and keeps going until the job is 100% complete.

## Keymaker — The Legitimate Craftsman

![Meet Keymaker](../.github/assets/keymaker.png)

In The Matrix, the Keymaker could craft keys to open any door — a master craftsman with unmatched precision and purpose, creating exactly what was needed to unlock any path.

**Meet the autonomous deep worker: Keymaker (GPT 5.3 Codex). The Legitimate Craftsman Agent.**

*Why "Legitimate"? When Anthropic blocked third-party access citing ToS violations, the community started joking about "legitimate" usage. Keymaker embraces this irony — he's the craftsman who builds things the right way, methodically and thoroughly, without cutting corners.*

Keymaker is inspired by [AmpCode's deep mode](https://ampcode.com) — autonomous problem-solving with thorough research before decisive action. He doesn't need step-by-step instructions; give him a goal and he'll figure out the rest.

### Key Characteristics

- **Goal-Oriented**: Give him an objective, not a recipe. He determines the steps himself.
- **Explores Before Acting**: Fires 2-5 parallel Trinity/Operator agents before writing a single line of code.
- **End-to-End Completion**: Doesn't stop until the task is 100% done with evidence of verification.
- **Pattern Matching**: Searches existing codebase to match your project's style — no AI slop.
- **Legitimate Precision**: Crafts code like a master keymaker — surgical, minimal, exactly what's needed.

## Cipher — The Language Architect

![Meet Cipher](../.github/assets/cipher.png)

In The Matrix, ciphers were the encoded signals flowing through the system — the raw language underneath reality itself. **Meet the DSL engineering specialist: Cipher (Claude Sonnet 4.6). The Language Architect.**

Cipher is the agent you call when you need to design, build, or extend domain-specific languages. He doesn't just write parsers — he thinks in grammars, type systems, and metamodels.

### Agent Characteristics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Model** | Claude Sonnet 4.6 (fallback: Claude Opus 4.6 → GPT 5.2 → Kimi K2.5 → Gemini 3.1 Pro) |
| **Mode** | `all` — selectable in agent menu AND spawnable as subagent |
| **Thinking** | Extended thinking enabled (32k budget) |
| **Max Tokens** | 64,000 — DSL tasks produce large outputs (grammars + parsers + code generators) |
| **Temperature** | 0.1 — precision-critical language engineering |
| **Denied Tools** | `delegate_agent` — Cipher uses direct tools (grep, LSP, AST-grep) for exploration |

### Five Sub-Specializations

- **Grammar Architect**: Formal grammar design (BNF/EBNF/PEG), operator precedence, disambiguation, grammar composition
- **Semantic Analyst**: Type systems (structural/nominal), scope analysis, constraint checking, static analysis
- **Toolsmith**: IDE/LSP integration, tree-sitter grammars, formatters, syntax highlighting, incremental parsing
- **Code Generator**: Transpilers, model-to-text transformations, multi-target code generation, source maps
- **Metamodel Designer**: textX/PyEcore metamodeling, model transformations (M2M/M2T), EMF-style engineering

### Framework Coverage

textX, ANTLR4, tree-sitter, Langium, Chevrotain, PyEcore — both external DSLs (custom syntax) and internal DSLs (fluent APIs/builder patterns).

### Cipher's Skill Architecture

Cipher's DSL knowledge is modular. Instead of a monolithic prompt, Cipher loads **11 composable skills** injected at agent build time. Any agent in the system can load the same DSL knowledge — Cipher isn't special, he's just the one who loads all of them by default.

| Skill | Domain | What It Contains |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| `dsl-core` | Foundations | 5 expert constraints (grammar-first, sound types, composability, error reporting, incremental parsing), framework selection guide, paradigm coverage, anti-patterns |
| `dsl-grammar` | Grammar & Parsing | EBNF reference, expression precedence-by-nesting pattern, declaration/statement patterns, common pitfalls, error recovery, framework adaptation |
| `dsl-codegen` | Code Generation | Source analysis, generator architecture (template/AST-walk/IR), language-specific idioms, multi-target generation |
| `dsl-metamodel` | Metamodeling & textX | Complete textX grammar reference (assignments, rule types, references, modifiers, scoping), Python API (`obj_processors`, `scope_providers`, custom classes), PyEcore patterns |
| `dsl-tooling` | IDE & Internal DSLs | Tree-sitter grammars, LSP implementation, fluent APIs, builder patterns, decorators, tagged template literals |
| `dsl-textx-ecosystem` | textX Ecosystem | Registration system (entry points, `textx_languages`/`textx_generators`), generator framework (`textx generate`, Jinja2), multi-file models (ModelRepository, FQNImportURI), language composition, visualization (dot/PlantUML), textX-LS |
| `dsl-pyecore-advanced` | PyEcore Advanced | Serialization (XMI/JSON, ResourceSet, URI), dynamic vs static metamodels (DynamicEPackage, pyecoregen), notifications (EObserver), @EMetaclass decorator, .ecore file loading, EMF interchange |
| `dsl-model-transformation` | M2M Transforms | Model-to-model transformation patterns (motra), in-place vs out-place, rule-based mapping, trace models, ATL-style patterns, M2T with Jinja2, protected regions |
| `dsl-testing` | DSL Testing | Grammar testing (pytest + textX), semantic validation testing (error assertions), code generator golden-file testing, property-based testing (Hypothesis), model roundtrip testing |
| `dsl-validation` | Advanced Validation | OCL-style constraint patterns, well-formedness rules, multiplicity/cardinality checks, referential integrity, cycle detection, validation framework pattern with severity levels |
| `dsl-composition` | Composition & Evolution | Language composition (multi-metamodel, grammar extension, referencing), DSL evolution (grammar versioning, backward compatibility), model migration, multiple concrete syntaxes |

**How skills compose:**

```
# Cipher loads ALL 11 (automatic — configured in the agent factory)
Cipher = dsl-core + dsl-grammar + dsl-codegen + dsl-metamodel + dsl-tooling
       + dsl-textx-ecosystem + dsl-pyecore-advanced + dsl-model-transformation
       + dsl-testing + dsl-validation + dsl-composition

# Other agents can load specific skills for focused tasks
task(category="source", load_skills=["dsl-core", "dsl-grammar"])                    # just grammar work
task(category="source", load_skills=["dsl-core", "dsl-codegen"])                     # just transpiler work
task(category="source", load_skills=["dsl-metamodel", "dsl-textx-ecosystem"])        # textX full stack
task(category="source", load_skills=["dsl-pyecore-advanced", "dsl-model-transformation"])  # PyEcore + M2M
task(category="source", load_skills=["dsl-testing", "dsl-validation"])               # testing + validation
task(category="source", load_skills=["dsl-composition"])                             # language composition
```

### Internal DSL Engineering Workflow

```

**Key design principle**: Cipher is the *language architect* — he designs the grammar, AST, type system, and code generation strategy. But he **delegates** the actual target-language implementation to language experts via `task(category="source")`. For multi-target generation (e.g., same DSL -> Python + TypeScript + Rust), Cipher fires delegations **in parallel**.
