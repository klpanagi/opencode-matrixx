/**
 * Task T1.1: 100-parallel-call race test for `tool.execute.before`.
 *
 * Validates that the 3-wave parallelization (Promise.all + Promise.allSettled
 * + sequential mutator chain) is safe under concurrent invocation:
 *
 *   1. Cross-call state isolation: 100 concurrent handler invocations with
 *      unique inputs (callID, sessionID, tool) each produce a correct
 *      output. No call's output is contaminated by another call's input.
 *
 *   2. Per-invocation hook coverage: every fast-fail hook is called for
 *      every invocation. This proves the refactor did not accidentally
 *      short-circuit any wave (e.g., an early return that skips Wave 3).
 *
 *   3. oracleMdOnly dual-invocation: since this hook runs in BOTH
 *      Wave 2 (BLOCKING) and Wave 3 (MUTATOR), it must be called exactly
 *      TWICE per invocation (200 total across 100 invocations).
 *
 * Task T1.4: `resolveSessionAgent` overlap test for the task tool.
 *
 * Validates that the network call for task-tool agent resolution runs in
 * PARALLEL with Wave 3 mutators (started before the mutator chain, awaited
 * after). Total elapsed time must be ~max(architectHook, resolve) instead of
 * architectHook + resolve.
 *
 * Uses spyOn (not `mock.module()`) to keep the test isolated from
 * CI's mock-heavy test list (see AGENTS.md "Tests that MUST be isolated").
