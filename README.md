<h1>Matrixx</h1>

**Multi-model agent orchestration for [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode).**<br/>
**11 specialized agents. 41 lifecycle hooks. 25+ tools. One plugin.**

*Use your existing ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini subscriptions. OpenCode covers them all.*

> *This is coding on steroids. Run background agents, delegate to specialists, refactor with LSP precision, and search the entire open-source ecosystem — all from your terminal.*

## Why Matrixx?

[OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) is the most powerful open-source AI coding agent — endlessly extensible, zero screen flicker, mix-and-match models. But raw power needs direction.

Matrixx turns a single agent into a **coordinated team** — each model doing what it does best, in parallel, with full context awareness. No more one-model-does-everything. No more context window bloat. No more agents that quit halfway.

| Problem | Matrixx Solution |
|---------|------------------|
| One model does everything poorly | **11 specialists** — right model for the right job |
| Agent forgets what it was doing | **Todo Continuation** — forces completion, no exceptions |
| Slow sequential tool calls | **Parallel background agents** — 5+ running simultaneously |
| AI-generated code looks like AI | **Comment Checker** — code indistinguishable from human-written |
| Context window fills up fast | **Aggressive delegation** — subagents carry the load |
| Fragile refactoring | **LSP + AST-Grep** — deterministic, safe, surgical |

## The Magic Word

**Don't want to read docs? Just type `ultrawork` (or `ulw`) in your prompt.**

That's it. Parallel agents, background tasks, deep exploration, relentless execution until completion. The agent figures out the rest.

### Morpheus — *The Orchestrator*
<img src=".github/assets/morpheus.png" width="120" align="right"/>

**Claude Opus 4.6** &middot; Primary agent

Plans, delegates, and executes. Fires background agents in parallel, leverages LSP for surgical refactoring, and never stops until the TODO list is empty.

**GPT 5.3 Codex** &middot; Autonomous deep worker

Give him a goal, not a recipe. Explores the codebase, matches your patterns, and delivers end-to-end. Inspired by [AmpCode's deep mode](https://ampcode.com).

## Get Started

**For humans** — paste this into Claude Code, AmpCode, Cursor, or any LLM agent:

```
Install and configure matrixx by following the instructions here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klpanagi/matrixx/refs/heads/dev/docs/guide/installation.md
```

**For LLM agents** — fetch and follow:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klpanagi/matrixx/refs/heads/dev/docs/guide/installation.md
```

We strongly recommend letting an agent handle installation. [Manual guide &rarr;](docs/guide/installation.md) &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; [Uninstall &rarr;](docs/guide/uninstallation.md)
