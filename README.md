<h1>Matrixx</h1>

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/opencode-matrixx.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencode-matrixx)

**Multi-model agent orchestration for [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode).**<br/>
**13 specialized agents. 41 lifecycle hooks. 25+ tools. One plugin.**

*Use your existing ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini subscriptions. OpenCode covers them all.*

> *This is coding on steroids. Run background agents, delegate to specialists, refactor with LSP precision, and search the entire open-source ecosystem — all from your terminal.*

## Why Matrixx?

[OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) is the most powerful open-source AI coding agent — endlessly extensible, zero screen flicker, mix-and-match models. But raw power needs direction.

Matrixx turns a single agent into a **coordinated team** — each model doing what it does best, in parallel, with full context awareness. No more one-model-does-everything. No more context window bloat. No more agents that quit halfway.

| Problem | Matrixx Solution |
|---------|------------------|
| One model does everything poorly | **13 specialists** — right model for the right job |
| Agent forgets what it was doing | **Todo Continuation** — forces completion, no exceptions |
| Slow sequential tool calls | **Parallel background agents** — 5+ running simultaneously |
| AI-generated code looks like AI | **Comment Checker** — code indistinguishable from human-written |
| Context window fills up fast | **Aggressive delegation** — subagents carry the load |
| Fragile refactoring | **LSP + AST-Grep** — deterministic, safe, surgical |

## The Magic Word

**Don't want to read docs? Just type `ultrawork` (or `ulw`) in your prompt.**

That's it. Parallel agents, background tasks, deep exploration, relentless execution until completion. The agent figures out the rest.

## Security

Matrixx includes a three-tier security layer: reactive hooks, configurable policies, and a dedicated security auditing agent.

### Enforcement Hooks

Built-in hooks protect against accidental secret exposure — no setup required.

| Hook | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Secret Leak Guard** | Intercepts `git commit` and `git push`, runs [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) on staged changes, and **blocks the operation** if secrets are detected. |
| **Env File Write Guard** | Blocks agents from writing to sensitive files (`.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `credentials.json`, `id_rsa`, and 16 other patterns). |

Both hooks are **enabled by default** and run before all other hooks in the execution pipeline. Configure via `matrixx.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "security": {
    "secret_scanning": { "enabled": true, "block_on_detection": true },
    "env_file_guard": { "enabled": true, "allowed_paths": [".env.example"] }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Secret scanning requires [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) installed in your PATH. Without it, the hook silently degrades.

### Sentinel — Security Auditing Agent

**Sentinel** is a read-only security specialist with 9 composable skills covering the full application security stack:

| Skill | Domain |
|-------|--------|
| `security-core` | OWASP Top 10, CWE classification, threat modeling (STRIDE) |
| `security-secrets` | Secret detection, credential scanning, pre-commit hooks |
| `security-sast` | Static analysis, code vulnerability patterns, taint tracking |
| `security-dast` | Dynamic analysis, runtime testing, fuzzing, penetration testing |
| `security-dependencies` | CVE scanning, SBOM generation, supply chain security |
| `security-api` | Authentication, authorization, CORS/CSRF, input validation |
| `security-crypto` | Encryption audit, key management, TLS, password hashing |
| `security-infra` | Container scanning, Dockerfile hardening, IaC audit, K8s security |
| `security-review` | Structured audit reports, severity classification, remediation guidance |

Sentinel never modifies code — it reports findings with CWE IDs, exact locations, and actionable remediation. Any agent can load individual security skills via `load_skills`.

## Get Started

### Install

```bash
npm install -g opencode-matrixx
```

### Via LLM agent

Paste this into Claude Code, AmpCode, Cursor, or any LLM agent:

```
Install and configure matrixx by following the instructions here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klpanagi/matrixx/refs/heads/dev/docs/guide/installation.md
```

**For LLM agents** — fetch and follow directly:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klpanagi/matrixx/refs/heads/dev/docs/guide/installation.md
```

We strongly recommend letting an agent handle installation. [Manual guide &rarr;](docs/guide/installation.md) &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; [Uninstall &rarr;](docs/guide/uninstallation.md)
