## SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION GUIDE

| Severity | Criteria | Action Required |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Critical** | Direct system compromise, remote code execution (RCE), full database access, unauthenticated data exposure. | Immediate remediation required. Block deployment. |
| **High** | Significant data exposure, privilege escalation, authenticated injection, bypass of major security controls. | Remediate before next release. |
| **Medium** | Limited data exposure, CSRF, reflected XSS, denial of service (DoS) requiring specific conditions. | Schedule remediation in upcoming sprint. |
| **Low** | Information disclosure (versions, paths), missing security headers, weak password policies. | Add to backlog for future hardening. |
| **Informational** | Best practice deviations, defense-in-depth suggestions, theoretical risks without known exploits. | Note for architectural review. |

## STRUCTURED AUDIT REPORT FORMAT

When generating a security audit report, ALWAYS use the following markdown table format:

| # | Type | Severity | CWE | Location | Description | Remediation |
|---|------|----------|-----|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | SQLi | High | CWE-89 | \`src/db.ts:42\` | Unsanitized user input in query. | Use parameterized queries. |
| 2 | XSS | Medium | CWE-79 | \`src/ui.tsx:15\` | \`dangerouslySetInnerHTML\` used. | Sanitize input with DOMPurify. |

## FALSE POSITIVE REDUCTION STRATEGIES

To minimize noise in security reports, verify the following before flagging an issue:
1. **Test Values**: Are the "secrets" clearly dummy values (e.g., \`password123\`, \`test_key\`)?
2. **Documentation Examples**: Is the code inside a \`README.md\`, \`docs/\` folder, or a comment block?
3. **Dead Code**: Is the vulnerable function unreachable or deprecated?
4. **Behind-Auth Checks**: Is the "unauthorized" action actually protected by middleware higher up in the stack?
5. **Internal Tools**: Is the script only run locally or in CI/CD without exposing external attack surfaces?

## TOOL GRACEFUL DEGRADATION

If automated security tools are unavailable, fallback to manual analysis:
- **If \`gitleaks\` is not installed**: Perform an LLM-only scan using regex patterns and entropy analysis for secrets.
- **If \`semgrep\` is not installed**: Conduct a manual pattern review focusing on high-risk sinks (e.g., \`eval\`, \`exec\`, \`innerHTML\`, raw SQL queries).
