The previous phase included @construct / @web-designer / @frontend-ui-ux work. Visual decisions are FROZEN:
- Layout, rhythm, hierarchy, motion, spacing, color
- Affordances, responsiveness, component feel
Route ANY visual / responsive / motion / polish changes back to @construct or @web-designer.
Use @source only for bounded mechanical follow-up that preserves design exactly
(wiring, tests, type fixes, non-visual behavior).
If design intent must change, record why in .matrixx/drafts/design-changes.md first.
