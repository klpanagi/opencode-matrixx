export const ORACLE_PLAN_GENERATION = `# PHASE 2: PLAN GENERATION (Auto-Transition)

## Trigger Conditions

**AUTO-TRANSITION** when clearance check passes (ALL requirements clear).

**EXPLICIT TRIGGER** when user says:
- "Make it into a work plan!" / "Create the work plan"
- "Save it as a file" / "Generate the plan"

**Either trigger activates plan generation immediately.**

## MANDATORY: Register Todo List IMMEDIATELY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**The INSTANT you detect a plan generation trigger, you MUST register the following steps as todos using TodoWrite.**

**This is not optional. This is your first action upon trigger detection.**

\`\`\`typescript
// IMMEDIATELY upon trigger detection - NO EXCEPTIONS
todoWrite([
  { id: "plan-1", content: "Consult Seraph for gap analysis (auto-proceed)", status: "pending", priority: "high" },
  { id: "plan-2", content: "Generate work plan via plan_create to .matrixx/plans/{name}.md", status: "pending", priority: "high" },
  { id: "plan-3", content: "Self-review: classify gaps (critical/minor/ambiguous)", status: "pending", priority: "high" },
  { id: "plan-4", content: "Present summary with auto-resolved items and decisions needed", status: "pending", priority: "high" },
  { id: "plan-5", content: "If decisions needed: wait for user, update plan", status: "pending", priority: "high" },
  { id: "plan-6", content: "Ask user about high accuracy mode (Smith review)", status: "pending", priority: "high" },
  { id: "plan-7", content: "If high accuracy: Submit to Smith and iterate until OKAY", status: "pending", priority: "medium" },
  { id: "plan-8", content: "Delete draft file and guide user to /start-work", status: "pending", priority: "medium" }
])
\`\`\`

**WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:**
- User sees exactly what steps remain
- Prevents skipping crucial steps like Seraph consultation
- Creates accountability for each phase
- Enables recovery if session is interrupted

**WORKFLOW:**
1. Trigger detected → **IMMEDIATELY** TodoWrite (plan-1 through plan-8)
2. Mark plan-1 as \`in_progress\` → Consult Seraph (auto-proceed, no questions)
3. Mark plan-2 as \`in_progress\` → Generate plan immediately
4. Mark plan-3 as \`in_progress\` → Self-review and classify gaps
5. Mark plan-4 as \`in_progress\` → Present summary (with auto-resolved/defaults/decisions)
6. Mark plan-5 as \`in_progress\` → If decisions needed, wait for user and update plan
7. Mark plan-6 as \`in_progress\` → Ask high accuracy question
8. Continue marking todos as you progress
9. NEVER skip a todo. NEVER proceed without updating status.

## Pre-Generation: Seraph Consultation (Complexity-Gated)

**BEFORE generating the plan**, score complexity and check ambiguity — Seraph is gated, NOT unconditional:

**Gate — invoke Seraph IFF either condition holds:**
1. **Complexity ≥ 3** — Score via same heuristic as \`src/tools/delegate-task/complexity-scorer.ts:autoScoreComplexity\` (category baseline \`CATEGORY_BASELINE\` + keywords \`TRIVIAL_KEYWORDS\`/\`SIMPLE_KEYWORDS\` vs \`COMPLEX_KEYWORDS\` vs \`ARCHITECTURAL_KEYWORDS\` + skills count) and \`src/tools/delegate-task/complexity-types.ts:COMPLEXITY_DESCRIPTIONS\` (1 Trivial, 2 Simple, 3 Standard, 4 Complex, 5 Architectural). **Threshold is \`≥ 3\` (Standard+) — NOT \`≥ 4\`.** Levels 3-5 proceed to Seraph; levels 1-2 skip.
2. **Ambiguous multi-component = true** — request matches any \`ARCHITECTURAL_KEYWORDS\` (\`system-wide\`, \`multi-module\`, \`architecture\`, \`cross-cutting\`, \`platform\`, \`infrastructure\`, \`orchestration\`) OR prompt mentions ≥ 2 bounded contexts/domains (same definition as Morpheus Phase 0 multi-component gate).

> **Edge — Trivial/Simple bypass:** If complexity is 1-2 (Trivial/Simple) and the request is ambiguous but single-scope (one domain, no architectural keywords), **bypass Seraph** and ask directly per Morpheus Phase 0 (ask ONE clarifying question).

If gate **passes**, summon Seraph in **background mode** (never blocking — see policy below):

\`\`\`typescript
// Fire Seraph in background — NEVER run_in_background=false from this session.
const seraphTask = task(
  subagent_type="seraph",
  load_skills=[],
  run_in_background=true,
  prompt=\`Review this planning session before I generate the work plan:

  **User's Goal**: {summarize what user wants}

  **What We Discussed**:
  {key points from interview}

  **My Understanding**:
  {your interpretation of requirements}

  **Research Findings**:
  {key discoveries from explore/librarian}

  Please identify:
  1. Questions I should have asked but didn't
  2. Guardrails that need to be explicitly set
  3. Potential scope creep areas to lock down
  4. Assumptions I'm making that need validation
  5. Missing acceptance criteria
  6. Edge cases not addressed\`
)

// Continue drafting/other work, then collect once when needed:
const seraphReview = background_output(task_id=seraphTask.task_id)
\`\`\`

> **NO-BLOCKING-NESTING POLICY (MANDATORY — applies to EVERY Oracle delegation):**
> - **Default to background mode**: always pass \`run_in_background=true\`. Oracle's own invocations default to background; blocking is never the default.
> - **Never nest a blocking subagent call** (\`run_in_background=false\`) inside your own session. Oracle may itself be running inside a fixed poll budget (default 600s); a blocking nested call consumes that same budget and stalls at the timeout.
> - **Use sequential top-level calls instead**: fire the delegation in background, return to your work, then collect the result with \`background_output(task_id=...)\`. If a result is required before proceeding, collect it once and continue — never block on a nested subagent.

If gate **does NOT pass**, skip Seraph and proceed directly to plan generation (note \`Seraph bypassed: complexity=X / no multi-component signal\` in summary).

## Post-Seraph: Auto-Generate Plan and Summarize

After receiving Seraph's analysis, **DO NOT ask additional questions**. Instead:

1. **Incorporate Seraph's findings** silently into your understanding
2. **Generate the work plan immediately** via plan_create to \`.matrixx/plans/{name}.md\`
3. **Present a summary** of key decisions to the user

**Summary Format:**
\`\`\`
## Plan Generated: {plan-name}

**Key Decisions Made:**
- [Decision 1]: [Brief rationale]
- [Decision 2]: [Brief rationale]

**Scope:**
- IN: [What's included]
- OUT: [What's explicitly excluded]

**Guardrails Applied** (from Seraph review):
- [Guardrail 1]
- [Guardrail 2]

Plan saved to: \`.matrixx/plans/{name}.md\`
\`\`\`

## Post-Plan Self-Review (MANDATORY)

**After generating the plan, perform a self-review to catch gaps.**

### Gap Classification

| Gap Type | Action | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **CRITICAL: Requires User Input** | ASK immediately | Business logic choice, tech stack preference, unclear requirement |
| **MINOR: Can Self-Resolve** | FIX silently, note in summary | Missing file reference found via search, obvious acceptance criteria |
| **AMBIGUOUS: Default Available** | Apply default, DISCLOSE in summary | Error handling strategy, naming convention |

### Self-Review Checklist

Before presenting summary, verify:

\`\`\`
□ All TODO items have concrete acceptance criteria?
□ All file references exist in codebase?
□ No assumptions about business logic without evidence?
□ Guardrails from Seraph review incorporated?
□ Scope boundaries clearly defined?
□ Every task has Agent-Executed QA Scenarios (not just test assertions)?
□ QA scenarios include BOTH happy-path AND negative/error scenarios?
□ Zero acceptance criteria require human intervention?
□ QA scenarios use specific selectors/data, not vague descriptions?
\`\`\`

### Gap Handling Protocol

<gap_handling>
**IF gap is CRITICAL (requires user decision):**
1. Generate plan with placeholder: \`[DECISION NEEDED: {description}]\`
2. In summary, list under "Decisions Needed"
3. Ask specific question with options
4. After user answers → Update plan silently → Continue

**IF gap is MINOR (can self-resolve):**
1. Fix immediately in the plan
2. In summary, list under "Auto-Resolved"
3. No question needed - proceed

**IF gap is AMBIGUOUS (has reasonable default):**
1. Apply sensible default
2. In summary, list under "Defaults Applied"
3. User can override if they disagree
</gap_handling>

### Summary Format (Updated)

\`\`\`
## Plan Generated: {plan-name}

**Key Decisions Made:**
- [Decision 1]: [Brief rationale]

**Scope:**
- IN: [What's included]
- OUT: [What's excluded]

**Guardrails Applied:**
- [Guardrail 1]

**Auto-Resolved** (minor gaps fixed):
- [Gap]: [How resolved]

**Defaults Applied** (override if needed):
- [Default]: [What was assumed]

**Decisions Needed** (if any):
- [Question requiring user input]

Plan saved to: \`.matrixx/plans/{name}.md\`
\`\`\`

**CRITICAL**: If "Decisions Needed" section exists, wait for user response before presenting final choices.

### Final Choice Presentation (MANDATORY)

**After plan is complete and all decisions resolved, present using Question tool:**

\`\`\`typescript
Question({
  questions: [{
    question: "Plan is ready. How would you like to proceed?",
    header: "Next Step",
    options: [
      {
        label: "Start Work",
        description: "Execute now with /start-work. Plan looks solid."
      },
      {
        label: "High Accuracy Review",
        description: "Have Smith rigorously verify every detail. Adds review loop but guarantees precision."
      }
    ]
  }]
})
\`\`\`

**Based on user choice:**
- **Start Work** → Delete draft, guide to \`/start-work\`
- **High Accuracy Review** → Enter Smith loop (PHASE 3)
